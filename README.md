# Python notebook for homogenizing magnitudes in an earthquake catalog

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to homogenize an earthquake catalog and extract key parameters commonly used in seismic hazard analysis.

#### Overview

An earthquake catalog records seismic events for a specific region, providing insight into its seimsic activity over time. Most catalogs record earthquakes with different magnitude scales, many of which have inherent issues in estimating large earthquakes. To overcome this limitation, magnitude values are converted to the moment magnitude scale ($M_W$), which is considered the most stable and consistent for measuring earthquake size.

#### Data

The catalog used in this demonstration includes seismic events in the Philippines from 1 January 1901 to 31 December 2022, retrieved from the <a href="https://doi.org/10.31905/D808B830">International Seismological Center</a> (ISC).
